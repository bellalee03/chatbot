# Overview
- This chatbot is an AI-powered application that answers questions by extracting relevant information from a specified text source. Initially configured with President Biden's 2022 speech as an example, the chatbot is designed to be versatile: you can replace the speech text with any other document in the data folder, and the chatbot will then use that new document as its primary data source.
- The chatbot can answer questions based on the contents of the text file located in the data folder. To focus on a different topic, replace the existing text file with your desired document. The chatbot will extract relevant information from this new document to answer queries.

# Features
- **Dynamic Text Source**: Primarily uses the text in the data folder for generating responses. Replace the text file with any document of your choice to change the chatbot's focus.
- **GPT-3 Integration**: Leverages OpenAI's GPT-3 for generating responses when the provided text does not contain relevant information.
- **Contextual and Concise Responses**: Designed to provide direct responses based on the context of the provided text, avoiding verbosity and repetition.
